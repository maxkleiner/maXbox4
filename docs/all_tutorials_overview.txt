machine code understood by computers. 
Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall 
execution time is comparatively slower than compilers. A compiler scans the entire program and 
translates it from object code as a whole into machine code. 

Tutor 103 Image2Text API
This API recognizes and reads a text embedded in pictures or photos.
Image to Text API uses a neural net (LSTM) based OCR engine which is focused on line recognition, but also supports recognizing the character patterns. It supports both handwriting and printed materials as well as street maps.

The restcountries project has been acquired by APIlayer. APILayer is an API marketplace where also your API can reach mores audiences.

Tutor 105 Classify Cifar10 CNN
This machine learning tutor explains a classifier based on the so called 
CIFAR-10 Image Classifier with a pre-trained model.
The pre-trained model is a file: ClassifyCNNModel_70.nn

Tutorial 106 Air Distance and Bearing, March 2023
As part of a unit on Trigonometry, we review compass and true bearings
before working with bearings in Trigonometry problems.
To start this review lesson, we looked at some images from Google Earth.

Tutorial 107 pas2js, March 2023
Pas2js is an open source Pascal (hJps://wiki.freepascal.org/Pascal) to JavaScript
(hJps://wiki.freepascal.org/JavaScript) transpiler. It parses Object Pascal or maXbox files and emits JavaScript. It takes Delphi/Lazarus projects and modules (.DPR, .LPR, .PAS, .PP) and converts them toJavaScript (.JS). The JavaScript is currently of level ECMAScript 5 and should run in any browser or inNode.js (target  nodejs ).

Tutorial 108 Hacking your M rklin, March 2023
Any ISP will need what Arduino calls output binaries and the rest of the world calls HEX files. These are produced when you Verify/Compile your sketch and contain the data the AVR microcontroller needs to run and in my case  C:\Users\max\AppData\Local\Temp\arduino_build_130743 .

Tutorial 109 Google Translate API, April 2023
Found a Google Translate endpoint that doesn't require an API key.
 Lost in translation   post to application . 
While digging or diving through the source code of Google's Google 
Dictionary Chrome extension, which has support for translating via Google
Translate, I found the endpoint they use in order to do just that

Tutorial 101 Data Science Story2
Regression is a Machine Learning task to predict continuous values (real numbers), as compared to classification, that is used to predict categorical (discrete) values.

Tutorial 102 Compiler versus Interpreter
Both compilers and interpreters are used to convert a program written in a high-level language into machine code understood by computers.
Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers. A compiler scans the entire program and translates it from object code as a whole into machine code.
