{Notes:
   This class is derived from TStList and allows all of
   the inherited list methods to be used.

   The "head" of the queue is element 0 in the list. The "tail" of the
   queue is the last element in the list.

   The dequeue can be used as a LIFO stack by calling PushTail and
   PopTail, or as a FIFO queue by calling PushTail and PopHead.
