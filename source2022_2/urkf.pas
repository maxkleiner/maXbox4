   Fehl takes one Fehlberg fourth-fifth order step (double precision).

   Discussion:

     This routine integrates a system of Neqn first order ordinary
     differential equations of the form
       dY(i)/dT = F(T,Y(1:Neqn))
     where the initial values Y and the initial derivatives
     YP are specified at the starting point T.

     The routine advances the solution over the fixed step H and returns
     the fifth order (sixth order accurate locally) solution
     approximation at T+H in array S.

     The formulas have been grouped to control loss of significance.
     The routine should be called with an H not smaller than 13 units of
     roundoff in T so that the various independent arguments can be
     distinguished.

   RKF45 carries out the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (double precision).


   Discussion:

     This routine is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff
     differential equations when derivative evaluations are inexpensive.
     It should generally not be used when the user is demanding
     high accuracy.

     This routine integrates a system of Neqn first-order ordinary
     differential equations of the form:

       dY(i)/dT = F(T,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(Neqn))

     where the Y(1:Neqn) are given at T.

     Typically the subroutine is used to integrate from T to TOUT but it
     can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a
     single step in the direction of TOUT.  On return, the parameters in
     the call list are set for continuing the integration.  The user has
     only to call again (and perhaps define a new value for TOUT).

     Before the first call, the user must

     * supply the subroutine F(T,Y,YP) to evaluate the right hand side;
       and declare F in an EXTERNAL statement;

     * initialize the parameters:
       Neqn, Y(1:Neqn), T, TOUT, RELERR, ABSERR, FLAG.
       In particular, T should initially be the starting point for integration,
       Y should be the value of the initial conditions, and FLAG should
       normally be +1.

     Normally, the user only sets the value of FLAG before the first call, and
     thereafter, the program manages the value.  On the first call, FLAG should
     normally be +1 (or -1 for single step mode.)  On normal return, FLAG will
     have been reset by the program to the value of 2 (or -2 in single
     step mode), and the user can continue to call the routine with that
     value of FLAG.

     (When the input magnitude of FLAG is 1, this indicates to the program
     that it is necessary to do some initialization work.  An input magnitude
     of 2 lets the program know that that initialization can be skipped,
     and that useful information was computed earlier.)

     The routine returns with all the information needed to continue
     the integration.  If the integration reached TOUT, the user need only
     define a new TOUT and call again.  In the one-step integrator
     mode, returning with FLAG = -2, the user must keep in mind that
     each step taken is in the direction of the current TOUT.  Upon
     reaching TOUT, indicated by the output value of FLAG switching to 2,
     the user must define a new TOUT and reset FLAG to -2 to continue
     in the one-step integrator mode.

     In some cases, an error or difficulty occurs during a call.  In that case,
     the output value of FLAG is used to indicate that there is a problem
     that the user must address.  These values include:

     * 3, integration was not completed because the input value of RELERR, the
       relative error tolerance, was too small.  RELERR has been increased
       appropriately for continuing.  If the user accepts the output value of
       RELERR, then simply reset FLAG to 2 and continue.

     * 4, integration was not completed because more than MAXNFE derivative
       evaluations were needed.  This is approximately (MAXNFE/6) steps.
       The user may continue by simply calling again.  The function counter
       will be reset to 0, and another MAXNFE function evaluations are allowed.

     * 5, integration was not completed because the solution vanished,
       making a pure relative error test impossible.  The user must use
       a non-zero ABSERR to continue.  Using the one-step integration mode
       for one step is a good way to proceed.

     * 6, integration was not completed because the requested accuracy
       could not be achieved, even using the smallest allowable stepsize.
       The user must increase the error tolerances ABSERR or RELERR before
       continuing.  It is also necessary to reset FLAG to 2 (or -2 when
       the one-step integration mode is being used).  The occurrence of
       FLAG = 6 indicates a trouble spot.  The solution is changing
       rapidly, or a singularity may be present.  It often is inadvisable
       to continue.

     * 7, it is likely that this routine is inefficient for solving
       this problem.  Too much output is restricting the natural stepsize
       choice.  The user should use the one-step integration mode with
       the stepsize determined by the code.  If the user insists upon
       continuing the integration, reset FLAG to 2 before calling
       again.  Otherwise, execution will be terminated.

     * 8, invalid input parameters, indicates one of the following:
       Neqn <= 0;
       T = TOUT and |FLAG| /= 1;
       RELERR < 0 or ABSERR < 0;
       FLAG == 0  or FLAG < -2 or 8 < FLAG.

   Parameters:

     Input, external F, a user-supplied subroutine to evaluate the
     derivatives Y (T), of the form:

       sub f ( t as double, y() as double, yp() as double )

     Input, Neqn, the number of equations to be integrated.

     Input/output, Y(Neqn), the current solution vector at T.

     Input/output, YP(Neqn), the current value of the
     derivative of the dependent variable.  The user should not set or alter
     this information

     Input/output, T, the current value of the independent
     variable.

     Input, TOUT, the output point at which solution is
     desired.  TOUT = T is allowed on the first call only, in which case
     the routine returns with FLAG = 2 if continuation is possible.

     Input, RELERR, ABSERR, the relative and absolute
     error tolerances for the local error test.  At each step the code
     requires:
       abs ( local error ) <= RELERR * abs ( Y ) + ABSERR
     for each component of the local error and the solution vector Y.
     RELERR cannot be "too small".  If the routine believes RELERR has been
     set too small, it will reset RELERR to an acceptable value and return
     immediately for user action.

     Input/output, FLAG, indicator for status of integration.
     On the first call, set FLAG to +1 for normal use, or to -1 for single
     step mode.  On return, a value of 2 or -2 indicates normal progress,
     while any other value indicates a problem that should be addressed.

{ Here begins the core integrator for taking a single step.

  The tolerances have been scaled to avoid premature underflow in
  computing the error tolerance function ET.
  To avoid problems with zero crossings, relative error is measured
  using the average of the magnitudes of the solution at the
  beginning and end of a step.
  The error estimate formula has been grouped to control loss of
  significance.

  To distinguish the various arguments, H is not permitted
  to become smaller than 26 units of roundoff in T.
  Practical limits on the change in the stepsize are enforced to
  smooth the stepsize selection process and to avoid excessive
  chattering on problems having discontinuities.
  To prevent unnecessary failures, the code uses 9/10 the stepsize
  it estimates will succeed.

  After a step failure, the stepsize is not allowed to increase for
  the next attempted step.  This makes the code more efficient on
  problems having discontinuities and more effective in general
  since local extrapolation is being used and extra caution seems
  warranted.
